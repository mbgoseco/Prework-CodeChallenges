--------------------------------
## Challenge 1: Array Max Result
Instructions: Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". The method you create should take in both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.
Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10. Output the array to the console and Ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.

## Challenge 2: Leap Year Calculator
Instructions: Given a year, report if it is a leap year.
A leap year occurs:
on every year that is evenly divisible by 4
  except every year that is evenly divisible by 100
    unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400

## Challenge 3: Perfect Sequence
Instructions: Given an array. Return "Yes" if the sequence is considered a perfect sequence. Otherwise, return "No"
A perfect sequence is a sequence such that all of its elements are non-negative integers and the product of all of them is equal to their sum. For example: [2,2], [1,3,2] and [0,0,0,0] are perfect sequences and [4,5,6] and [0,2,-2] are not perfect sequences. Negative numbers of any kind are not valid in a perfect sequence

## Challenge 4: Sum of Rows
Instructions: Given a matrix of integers. Return the sum of each row in a single dimensional array.
A multidimensional array with the dimensions of m x n (m = rows, n = columns).

duplicate integers are possible.
Negative numbers are possible
both m and n can vary in length
The user should specify the length and the width of the array within the console. To populate the numbers, you may randomly generate them, or have the user input one by one.

The method should take in the multidimensional array and return the single dimensional array with the sums
